/WordUtils.py,22:8-22:73,,"The documentation for the abbreviate method states that the upper limit can be specified as -1 if no limit is desired. However, the method's implementation lacks specific handling for the case when -1 is provided as the upper limit. As a result, the code does not align with the indicated functionality.\n\nIt's essential to ensure that the implementation reflects the documented behavior for consistency and accuracy. Therefore, the method should be updated to properly handle the case where -1 is provided as the upper limit, as indicated in the documentation."
/WordUtils.py,59:12-59:42,,"Due to the if-else, we already know that upper <= index (thus index is always the max of the two). Thus, without checking closely, something unintended is probably going on here. Pls double-check"
/WordUtils.py,153:32-153:75,,"The contains_all_words function checks if a given string contains all the words in the provided array. However, there seems to be an issue with the existing implementation. The function uses word boundaries (\b) to search for the words, but parentheses are also considered word boundaries. This might cause problems when searching for words containing parentheses.\n\nIt's important to reassess the logic and possibly consider alternative ways to search for the presence of words without encountering issues related to the use of word boundaries.\n\nRevisiting the implementation to ensure it accurately detects the presence of words without unintended behaviors related to word boundaries will improve the robustness and reliability of the function."
/WordUtils.py,263:4-263:71,,"Overall, the functionality of the wrap method seems to be appropriately structured. However, it may benefit from some improvements. In particular, the variable names 'wlen', 'wlong', 'wtext', and 's' could be made more descriptive to enhance readability and maintainability of the code.\n\nFor example, 's' could be renamed to 'segments' or 'split_text', 'wtext' to 'wrapped_text', 'wlong' to 'long_words_enabled', and 'wlen' to 'wrap_length', which more clearly convey their purposes. Descriptive variable names can greatly enhance the readability and understanding of the code, resulting in improved maintainability and future development.\n\nI would recommend providing more meaningful and descriptive names for the variables in order to improve the overall quality of the code.\n\n\n"
/WordUtils.py,15:12-15:13,,typo ;-) use lowercase `string` everywhere
