/tic_tac_toe.py,91:0-95:21,,There is duplicated logic for checking if someone has won which could be refactored into its own function.
/tic_tac_toe.py,87:8-87:76,,The printing of the board is repeated several times throughout the play function. It could be refactored into its own function to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
/tic_tac_toe.py,44:4-44:18,,The retrieval of empty spaces into the grid is repeated several times throughout the differnt functions. It could be refactored into its own function to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
/tic_tac_toe.py,105:12-106:62,,"The user input is not validated. If a user inputs a character that is not a number or an occupied position, the program will crash with a ValueError. Implementing input validation would improve the robustness."
/tic_tac_toe.py,76:4-76:17,,"The current return statement of return choice should actually be modified to return choice + 1. While the game's internal logic appears to be accurate, the output communicated to the player does not align with a typical user's expectation of a 1-based index for the move position. Adjusting the return value to reflect this will improve the player's experience by providing a more intuitive move announcement."
/tic_tac_toe.py,86:14-86:44,,There seems to be repeated logic present for verifying if the grid is full. This could be streamlined into a dedicated function.
/tic_tac_toe.py,79:4-79:11,,"Think about restructuring the play() function by separating out certain tasks. Specifically, creating specialized functions to handle the AI's turns and the human player's moves in the game could be beneficial."

/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,63:8-65:59,,This is repeated in line 69-71. Consider to extract it as a method
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,66:16-66:21,,"I might be wrong: this break stops testing more winning lines, but it does not stop testing more choices. Looks like the algorithm may keep looking further after it finds a winning move. "
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,68:12-68:28,,The simulated play in line 64 might need to be removed before attempting this simulated play
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,65:33-65:46,,It seems that this assert needs to be done using brd instead of board. Not sure if board has the simulated play at this point. 
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,88:26-88:53,,This might need a +1 increment since my_better_turn returns a 0-based position
