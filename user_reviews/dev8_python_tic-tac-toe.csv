/tic_tac_toe.py,91:0-95:21,,There is duplicated logic for checking if someone has won which could be refactored into its own function.
/tic_tac_toe.py,87:8-87:76,,The printing of the board is repeated several times throughout the play function. It could be refactored into its own function to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
/tic_tac_toe.py,44:4-44:18,,The retrieval of empty spaces into the grid is repeated several times throughout the differnt functions. It could be refactored into its own function to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
/tic_tac_toe.py,105:12-106:62,,"The user input is not validated. If a user inputs a character that is not a number or an occupied position, the program will crash with a ValueError. Implementing input validation would improve the robustness."
/tic_tac_toe.py,76:4-76:17,,"The current return statement of return choice should actually be modified to return choice + 1. While the game's internal logic appears to be accurate, the output communicated to the player does not align with a typical user's expectation of a 1-based index for the move position. Adjusting the return value to reflect this will improve the player's experience by providing a more intuitive move announcement."
/tic_tac_toe.py,86:14-86:44,,There seems to be repeated logic present for verifying if the grid is full. This could be streamlined into a dedicated function.
/tic_tac_toe.py,79:4-79:11,,"Think about restructuring the play() function by separating out certain tasks. Specifically, creating specialized functions to handle the AI's turns and the human player's moves in the game could be beneficial."
/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,27:0-41:17,,remove this as it's not being called
/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,57:4-57:6,,can we have more descriptive variable names?\nhard to follow it this way
/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,59:14-59:71,,two list comprehensions gets a bit hard to follow
/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,59:15-59:25,,do we need `int(s) - 1` if we index board starting from 0?
/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,21:8-21:25,,should the index start with 0? see related comment below
/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,61:8-61:22,,maybe use `board.copy()`? clearer\ncould this be outside of the loop?
/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,88:8-88:54,,"again on board not starting with 0.\nconsider a first round,\nit says ""I go at 5"" as choosing index 5, but the board will still show 5 as unnocupied"
/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,74:57-74:79,,is picking a random choice here preventing the other player from winning?
