/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,58:8-59:80,,"The method properly validates the upper parameter, ensuring it is not less than 0 and not less than lower. However, the documentation suggests that an upper value of -1 indicates no limit, which is not implemented or handled in the code."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,151:8-152:36,,"The variable names ""ds"" and ""sl"" are not particularly meaningful and may lead to confusion for anyone reading the code. It's important to use descriptive variable names that convey the purpose or intent of the variable to ensure better readability and maintainability. Consider using more descriptive names that provide clarity about the values they represent within the context of the method."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,164:12-174:13,,"In the given code block, there is an unnecessary nested if-else block that could be simplified. The else block contains an additional if-else statement. To enhance clarity and reduce complexity, the inner if-else block can be refactored, possibly using a ternary conditional operator or by reorganizing the code logic to eliminate the need for nested conditional checks. This will help improve the readability and maintainability of the code."
