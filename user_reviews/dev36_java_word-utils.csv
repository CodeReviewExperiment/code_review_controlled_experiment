/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,36:75-36:75,BUG: Upper doesn't support -1,"In the comments, it says upper can be ""-1 if no limit is desired"" but in the code, it just returns an error."
/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,35:43-35:43,BUG: No check on negative valued lower limit ,"The comment says ""negative value is treated as zero"" but this isn't actually handled in the code."
/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,86:14-86:14,BUG: Check if abbreviation has occurred,You could still have not abbreviated the string. You need to add a check here as well before appeding the string to the end.
/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,147:31-147:31,FIX: Add inline comments,It is very difficult to understand what is going on here. Add inline comments with more detail like in abbreviate() function.

/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,21:20-21:20,FIX: Code is hard to read,The code is hard to read and understand. The comments at the top of the function describe very clearly what the code is supposed to do but it is very hard to check and confirm it does what it should. Consider adding better variable names and explaining with detailed inline comments in each function.
/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,356:26-356:26,FIX: Don't make str.length() into a variable,"sl is very hard to read. Just use str.length(). It is much easier to read. Since this is only used twice in the function, it is not important for performance."
