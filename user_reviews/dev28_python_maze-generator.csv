/cr-study-2024/python/maze-generator/maze_generator.py,8:4-9:64,,The function does not validate the provided w and h arguments beyond the recommendation in the docstring that at least one dimension should be greater than 2. Adding explicit checks and raising a ValueError for invalid dimensions would make the program more robust.

/cr-study-2024/python/maze-generator/maze_generator.py,4:0-4:24,,what about using width and height instead of their abbreviations?

/cr-study-2024/python/maze-generator/maze_generator.py,57:12-57:20,,is it possible to provide more meaningful variable names?
