/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,21:0-21:24,,"The WordUtils class is well-designed with a clear focus on handling strings in various useful ways. Its methods are well-documented, and the overall approach is consistent. \n\nIf performance and memory footprint are critical, consider using specialized collections for primitive types to avoid the overhead of boxing in methods like generateDelimiterSet."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,57:4-57:103,,"The abbreviation logic is clear, using a StringBuilder for efficient string manipulation. However, it could be enhanced to handle the -1 case for upper as an unlimited length."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,58:8-59:80,,"The method properly validates the upper parameter, ensuring it is not less than 0 and not less than lower. However, the documentation suggests that an upper value of -1 indicates no limit, which is not implemented or handled in the code."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,147:4-147:81,,"capitalize and capitalizeFully method:\n\nBoth methods support custom delimiter sets for identifying word boundaries, which is flexible. The use of a Set<Integer> for delimiters is efficient for lookup but requires additional boxing and unboxing of char to Integer.\n\nThe overloading strategy for capitalize and capitalizeFully with or without delimiters is consistent and user-friendly."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,256:4-256:98,,"This method uses regex to check if all words are contained in the given string, which may not be the most efficient approach for large strings or a large number of words. A more efficient algorithm that doesn't use regex could be considered."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,279:4-279:79,,This private helper method efficiently prepares a set of delimiters for other methods. Its restricted visibility is appropriate given its specific utility to this class.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,344:4-344:79,,"The method correctly extracts initials based on whitespace or specified delimiters. The handling of delimiters is consistent with other methods, making the API predictable."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,393:4-393:53,,"This method provides an interesting feature by swapping the case of characters based on word boundaries and character case. The logic is sound, though it involves several conditionals and might benefit from comments explaining the rationale for each case."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,470:4-470:83,,"The uncapitalize method complements capitalize, offering inverse functionality. It maintains consistency in handling delimiters and null inputs."
/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,21:15-21:15,,Code is clear and very well documented. Previous reviewer already noted everything and I have nothing meaningful to add
