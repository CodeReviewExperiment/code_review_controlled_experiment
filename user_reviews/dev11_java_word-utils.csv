/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,58:8-59:80,,"The method properly validates the upper parameter, ensuring it is not less than 0 and not less than lower. However, the documentation suggests that an upper value of -1 indicates no limit, which is not implemented or handled in the code."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,151:8-152:36,,"The variable names ""ds"" and ""sl"" are not particularly meaningful and may lead to confusion for anyone reading the code. It's important to use descriptive variable names that convey the purpose or intent of the variable to ensure better readability and maintainability. Consider using more descriptive names that provide clarity about the values they represent within the context of the method."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,164:12-174:13,,"In the given code block, there is an unnecessary nested if-else block that could be simplified. The else block contains an additional if-else statement. To enhance clarity and reduce complexity, the inner if-else block can be refactored, possibly using a ternary conditional operator or by reorganizing the code logic to eliminate the need for nested conditional checks. This will help improve the readability and maintainability of the code."

It's crucial to use descriptive variable names that clearly convey the purpose or intent of the variable within the method. Consider using a more descriptive name that accurately reflects the role or significance of the variable in the context of the method to improve code readability and maintainability."

/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,66:8-66:33,,This checks that the lower value is not greater than the length of the string. In the documentation it is additionally stated that if a negative lower value is treated as zero. This is not implemented in the code.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,135:23-135:23,,"This example has invalid input as the symbol * is not a string. Probably ""*"" was intended."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,157:0-175:9,,This could be simplified by iterating on the characters in the string directly using str.toCharArray().\n\nThe new string can be built using a StringBuilder which would simplify the code further.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,216:12-216:12,,"This example has invalid input as the symbol * is not a string. Probably ""*"" was intended.\n\nAlso below there are similar cases, as well as in other parts of the file."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,261:17-261:17,,"This also checks if the word is "" "" (space). Please updated the documentation if this is intended."
