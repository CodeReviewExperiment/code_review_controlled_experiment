/WordUtils.py,145:8-145:19,,"The variable name flag lacks descriptiveness, making it hard to understand its purpose at a glance. Consider renaming it to capitalize_next for greater clarity, which more accurately reflects its role in determining when to capitalize the next character in the sequence."
/WordUtils.py,411:8-411:19,,"The variable name flag lacks descriptiveness, making it hard to understand its purpose at a glance. Consider renaming it to uncapitalize_next for greater clarity, which more accurately reflects its role in determining when to uncapitalize the next character in the sequence."
/WordUtils.py,297:8-297:19,,"The naming of the variable flag could be enhanced to better convey its purpose within the function. Consider renaming it to last_was_gap, which more accurately describes its role in identifying whether the last character was a delimiter or whitespace, thus improving code readability."
/WordUtils.py,341:8-341:17,,"The variable name ws is not sufficiently descriptive, making its purpose unclear. It is recommended to rename it to whitespace to more clearly reflect that it indicates the presence or handling of whitespace in the string manipulation logic."
/WordUtils.py,152:12-157:36,,The code contains a redundant nested if-else structure that could be simplified. Consider revising this part of the code to enhance clarity.

/WordUtils.py,63:8-66:68,,"The method properly validates the upper parameter, ensuring it is not less than 0 and not less than lower. However, the documentation suggests that an upper value of -1 indicates no limit, which is not implemented or handled in the code."
/WordUtils.py,71:8-72:31,,The documentation says that negative values for `lower` are treated as zero. Shouldn't this be implemented? I'm not sure whether implementing it changes the behavior though.
/WordUtils.py,147:8-147:37,,"The name of this callback is not descriptive enough, consider renaming it to something like `capitalize_if_after_delimiter`."
/WordUtils.py,148:12-148:25,,"Using this mutable reference in a list comprehension is not ideal; in this case it might be ok because its scope is very limited, but in a larger program this could quickly make it difficult to understand.\n\nConsider changing this to using a `reduce` call where you keep as accumulator the result string and the flag."
/WordUtils.py,238:42-238:69,,This could simply be `all(words)`.
/WordUtils.py,242:12-243:28,,"This means we can't search for ""whitespace words"". It's true that whitespace can't really be considered words, but it should probably be mentioned in the doc string."
