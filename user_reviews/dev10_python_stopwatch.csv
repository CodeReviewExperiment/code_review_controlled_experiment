/cr-study-2024/python/stopwatch/StopWatch.py,12:27-12:27,"To avoid typos (e.g., one too many or too few 0) and make the constant number more readable, 1000 * 1000 (where 1000 could be another constant THOUSAND) could help.\n\nAlso, it's 1'000'000 nanos that make one milli, the variable name should be MILLI_2_NANOS."
/cr-study-2024/python/stopwatch/StopWatch.py,26:23-26:30,"It's probably more intuitive to call this variable (and the corresponding method ""get_message"") `name`, since it's used on construction to help distinguish our stopwatch from others."
/cr-study-2024/python/stopwatch/StopWatch.py,252:0-253:0,"The documentation is either outdated or we miss the part to clear the stop time (some notes about the stop time are above), since the method only removes the split state. "
/cr-study-2024/python/stopwatch/StopWatch.py,36:7-39:33,"We don't need to keep track of the start and stop time twice for both units, because we can use a conversion function (e.g., nanos_to_milis) if we need the other unit somewhere. Apart from avoiding duplication, this also helps to reduce bugs.\n\nA variable which might be useful instead is ""split_time"" that can be either -1 or a given split time, because the split functionality doesn't stop the watch and it's technically not the stop_time that we should set. This also helps to improve readability."
/cr-study-2024/python/stopwatch/StopWatch.py,183:0-184:0,"This method currently only resets the two states, but the comment states that the method also resets the times. We either need to update the comment or add that functionality. I would go for adding the functionality, because otherwise we probably get bugs (the same goes for my comment in the unsplit function)."
/cr-study-2024/python/stopwatch/StopWatch.py,216:0-217:79,"Instead of having two if statements that raise both the same ValueError, we can combine them with an ""or"" to one. Like this:\n```        if self.running_state == self.State.RUNNING or self.running_state == self.State.STOPPED:\n            raise ValueError(""Stopwatch must be reset before being restarted."")```\n\nFurthermore I would rather check that we are either in UNSTARTED or SUSPENDED to also exclude possible erraneous states that aren't RUNNING OR STOPPED."
/cr-study-2024/python/stopwatch/StopWatch.py,177:0-178:0,Attention with the return type here: We are dividing which can lead to floats.
/cr-study-2024/python/stopwatch/StopWatch.py,72:0-73:0,"As stated with the variables above, we don't need two ""get_time"" functions, since we can use a conversion function. The same goes for the other nano_time functions here."
/cr-study-2024/python/stopwatch/StopWatch.py,224:4-224:12,"This shows what I meant with not having two stop times above in the constructor: We forgot to set the mili seconds start time here which will lead to inconsistent results depending on the functions used  (i.e. if you get the time in milliseconds later on with ""get_start_time"", you will get the first start time, not the resumed one.)"
