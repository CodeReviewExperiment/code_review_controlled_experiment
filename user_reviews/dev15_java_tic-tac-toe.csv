Otherwise, it incorrectly accepts any input for saying they want to play. This includes lowercase ""y"" as well as any other input."
/cr-study-2024/java/tic-tac-toe/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,162:24-162:48,,"The logic for checking for wins is slightly off. In the case where the computer makes the winning move, the human is still able to make one more move even though the computer has already won. Also, sometimes after the computer has already made the winning move, if the human makes the next move their winning move, the game will say the human won even though the computer should still have won."
/cr-study-2024/java/tic-tac-toe/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,132:16-132:56,,It would be better to have this message print out before every instance a human player is to make a move.
/cr-study-2024/java/tic-tac-toe/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,107:16-107:23,,"This function could be better modularized or at least commented better for clarity. Right now, the logic for the gameplay is all bunched together, which makes readability and debugging more difficult."
/cr-study-2024/java/tic-tac-toe/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,19:4-19:102,,"It's better practice to ""close"" the BufferedReader once it's done being used."
/cr-study-2024/java/tic-tac-toe/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,17:13-17:22,,"Overall, it would be better to have more comments throughout the code. Especially in the functions/methods, as it would be better for more clarity and readability."
/cr-study-2024/java/tic-tac-toe/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,244:7-244:70,,"Having comments in this function's body on how the computer is actually deciding its next move would be beneficial for other people reading the code. Especially the switch statement which involves the different ""cases"" based on the human player's moves. At face value, that part can be very confusing and hard to understand."
