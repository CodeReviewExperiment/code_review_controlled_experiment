/cr-study-2024/java/number-conversion/src/main/java/org/crprojects/NumberConversion.java,71:8-71:40,BUG: input >= 4000 not > 4000,"Bounds checking in decimalToRoman prevents negative numbers and those greater than 4000, which is excellent. However, the condition should reject the number 4000 as well since it's not representable in the standard Roman numeral system (I to MMMCMXCIX)."
