/WordUtils.py,145:8-145:19,,"The variable name flag lacks descriptiveness, making it hard to understand its purpose at a glance. Consider renaming it to capitalize_next for greater clarity, which more accurately reflects its role in determining when to capitalize the next character in the sequence.\n\nAgree with this."
/WordUtils.py,411:8-411:19,,"The variable name flag lacks descriptiveness, making it hard to understand its purpose at a glance. Consider renaming it to uncapitalize_next for greater clarity, which more accurately reflects its role in determining when to uncapitalize the next character in the sequence.\n\nAgree with this."
/WordUtils.py,297:8-297:19,,"The naming of the variable flag could be enhanced to better convey its purpose within the function. Consider renaming it to last_was_gap, which more accurately describes its role in identifying whether the last character was a delimiter or whitespace, thus improving code readability.\n\nAgree with this."
/WordUtils.py,341:8-341:17,,"The variable name ws is not sufficiently descriptive, making its purpose unclear. It is recommended to rename it to whitespace to more clearly reflect that it indicates the presence or handling of whitespace in the string manipulation logic.\n\nAgree with this."
/WordUtils.py,152:12-157:36,,The code contains a redundant nested if-else structure that could be simplified. Consider revising this part of the code to enhance clarity and efficiency.
/WordUtils.py,418:12-423:36,,The code contains a redundant nested if-else structure that could be simplified. Consider revising this part of the code to enhance clarity and efficiency.\n\nAgree with this.
/WordUtils.py,63:8-66:68,,"The method properly validates the upper parameter, ensuring it is not less than 0 and not less than lower. However, the documentation suggests that an upper value of -1 indicates no limit, which is not implemented or handled in the code.\n\nAgree with this review. It should be specified at the top of the function that the -1 parameter will raise an exception, since not yet implemented. Another suggestion would be to assign the `upper` to the length of the passed string when it's negative, and thus specifying in the comment section this behavior."
/WordUtils.py,71:0-75:31,,"Given that the `lower` parameter is always smaller/equal to/than the `upper` parameter due to the previous condition, we can remove the second if statement and assign both `lower` and `upper` to `len(string)`. That is:\n\n```\nif lower > len(string):\n  lower = upper = len(string)\n```"
/WordUtils.py,81:0-83:81,,The `!=` can be changed to `<` given that the `upper` parameter if greater than the `len(string)` will be assigned to that length. 
/WordUtils.py,162:0-205:64,,"We can include this capitalize fully as a functionality of the capitalize function itself. A flag that would allow the user to choose a full capitalization, and leave it as False by default. We will just need one function in this case."
/WordUtils.py,212:0-213:70,,"It should also specify that if one element of the array is an empty string (in the condition `not all(word for word in words)`), or string with only whitespace (in the condition `if not word.strip()`), it will return False in that case."
/WordUtils.py,210:1-210:67,,Should specify that the check is case-sensitive.
