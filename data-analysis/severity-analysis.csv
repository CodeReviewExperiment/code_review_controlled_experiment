"In the toString() method, using StringBuilder is a more efficient way of creating a string than using String concatenation in loops, which is good.

"There is a critical bug. For HEXADECIMAL, it erroneously uses base 8 instead of 16. It should be decimalToAnyBase(num, 16).",java-number-conversion,3,3,3,I
"Bounds checking in decimalToRoman prevents negative numbers and those greater than 4000, which is excellent. However, the condition should reject the number 4000 as well since it's not representable in the standard Roman numeral system (I to MMMCMXCIX).",java-number-conversion,3,3,3,I
"There is a mismatch between the error message and the input validation. The method validates that the input is not less than 0 by accepting values equal to zero, yet the error message incorrectly states that the input must be greater than zero.",java-number-conversion,3,3,3,I
"The comment on the decimalToAnyBase method incorrectly states ""converts decimal to Roman format"". This seems to be a copy-paste error from the other method, and should describe conversion to a generic base instead.",java-number-conversion,2,2,2,I

An enhancement could be the isolation of shared logic between stop() and suspend() into a separate private method to avoid duplication.",java-stopwatch,2,1,1.5,A

typo?,java-stopwatch,1,1,1,D
"The documentation for the isStopped() method is inaccurate.

This discrepancy should be addressed to ensure clarity and correctness for users of this method.",java-stopwatch,2,2,2,I
"The documentation for the isSuspended() method contains inaccuracies. The main description should reflect that the method is testing whether the stopwatch is suspended, not just started. Additionally, the @return description is incorrect, as it should specify that the method returns a boolean indicating whether the stopwatch is suspended. These issues need to be corrected for better clarity and understanding.",java-stopwatch,2,2,2,I
It doesn't check if it's been previously split,java-stopwatch,2,3,2.5,D
The stop method contains an unnecessary nested if statement.

Reducing the complexity of these conditional checks will lead to improved readability and maintainability of the code.,java-stopwatch,1,3,2,I
