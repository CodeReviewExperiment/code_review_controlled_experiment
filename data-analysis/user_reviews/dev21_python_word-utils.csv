/WordUtils.py,63:8-64:65,Mismatching logic w.r.t business logic,"The method logic is sound for abbreviating strings based on lower and upper limits. However, the initial check for upper < 0 might be unnecessary since the method raises an error if upper is less than lower, and there's a later condition that sets upper to the string length if it's greater. However, this is misleading because the method documentation says to specify -1 to disable the upper limit, but this condition will prevent using -1 as intended. This seems to be a discrepancy between the documentation and implementation."
/WordUtils.py,91:4-91:70,Leverage Python's built-in operations,"Both methods capitalize and capitalize_fully handle capitalization using a set of delimiters. The implementation with a callback and flag is correct but might be more complex than necessary. Python's string methods, such as split and join, along with list comprehensions, could potentially simplify the implementation."
/WordUtils.py,163:4-163:76,Optimizing efficiency when large strings,This method effectively calls capitalize on a lowercased version of the input string. This is a clean way to ensure full capitalization but may introduce extra processing for large strings. Consider if direct manipulation without lowering and then capitalizing might be more efficient in some cases.
/WordUtils.py,244:12-244:70,Optimize loop operations for increased performance,"The method compiles a new regex for each word checked. Compiling regexes can be expensive, especially in a loop for many words. Consider if there's a way to check word presence without compiling a regex for each word, possibly using set operations or other string methods."
/WordUtils.py,312:4-312:41,Optimize swap case,"The custom logic for swapping case based on character position and whitespace detection is correct. However, this method's logic might be more complex than necessary for achieving the desired result, especially considering Python's built-in swapcase method, which swaps the case of all letters in a string. The additional logic for handling title case and conversion after whitespace or at the start adds value beyond swapcase, but it's worth noting the complexity added."
/WordUtils.py,362:4-362:72,Leverage Python's built-in operations,"Similar to capitalize: This method shares logic with capitalize, but inversely applies case changes. The same suggestions about simplification apply here."
/WordUtils.py,65:11-65:24,Mismatching logic w.r.t business logic,"Validation should be revised as per the previous comment regarding the first validation i.e., if upper != -1 and upper < lower:"
/WordUtils.py,143:8-143:18,Improve delimeters handling,"Dictionary comprehension is in place but should not be used, moreover its syntax is not correct, employ list comprehension instead, it explicitly handles 'none'. Additionally, a none parameter can be evaluated in advance i.e., if not delimiters then delimiters = [' ']"
