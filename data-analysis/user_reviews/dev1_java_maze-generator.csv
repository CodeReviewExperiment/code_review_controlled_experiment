/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,17:2-23:45,,"To clarify how these strings are used, it's better to have an example of output maze as part of the doc."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,15:4-15:31,,Why `int`? What do different values represent?
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,44:8-47:62,,Please use a `StringBuilder`
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,48:8-48:22,,"If this function is expensive, should we cache the result?"
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,57:4-57:38,,We need a guard to check `row` is within the boundary.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,60:48-60:51,,It's not clear why you are doing the `& 1`
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,60:29-60:57,,Nit: `... = ((grid[row][column] & 1) == 0)`
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,52:5-52:67,,This method needs a more detailed doc on the steps taken for building an output row.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,21:4-22:47,,It's not clear the difference between `V_WALL_` and `V_` variables. Add some doc please.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,72:8-72:43,,Please fully parenthesize to avoid confusion.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,98:4-98:45,,Why is this method `static`? To me `maze.populate()` is nicer API.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,109:4-109:61,,"Similar comment as above. Why is this method `static`? To me `maze.populate(0, 0)` is nicer API."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,43:0-44:0,,Where do we check if the maze is populated? We should return an error if `grid` is not ready.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,130:27-130:34,,"Very bad name, as from `between` name one expects three args. \n\nSince we already have the maze dims, we can have methods `in_maze_range_x(int nx)` and `in_maze_range_y(ny)`."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,140:8-140:20,,"Question: Do we need this? Doesn't `N(1, 0, -1)` implicitly intialized enum memebers?"
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,115:12-119:13,,"Bug: Once we find a way to go, we should `break` this for-loop. Otherwise, from each cell we go to all four directions once `populate` recusrive call finishes."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,109:4-109:61,,Two notes:\n1. This recurive method has no base condition. When do stop exploring? When all grid values are non-`0`?\n\n2. The problem requirement says: `Both the upper left and lower right vertical walls of the maze are open.`. How do we meet this requirement with this implementation?
