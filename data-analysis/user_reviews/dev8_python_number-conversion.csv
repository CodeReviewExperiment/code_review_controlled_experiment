/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversion.py,2:0-2:0,,"Functions are well-organized and focused on singular tasks, with decimal_to_any_format as the top-level function that delegates to system-specific conversion functions based on the format passed.\n\nThe code adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines, with appropriate naming conventions and documentation through docstrings.\n\nType hints are provided for function parameters and return types, improving the code's readability and allowing for static type checking.\n\nProvided for each function, mentioning purpose, parameters, and return type; however, the decimal_to_roman docstring contains a mismatch regarding the range it allows."
/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversion.py,41:3-44:7,,"In decimal_to_roman, the error message does not match the condition checked in code. The documentation states ""0 and 4000 (both included)"" but the code excludes both these values. It should be corrected to match."
/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversion.py,36:8-36:64,,Format.HEXADECIMAL incorrectly points to base 8. It should be 16.
/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversion.py,73:8-73:25,,div = num // base appears to be redundant and could be removed since divmod is already used above.
/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversion.py,66:4-66:19,,"The while div != 1: condition in decimal_to_any_base serves no purpose and is misleading because div is set to 0 before the loop; thus, div != 1 is always True."
/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversion.py,77:8-77:22,,"The elif div == 1: block in decimal_to_any_base can be removed, as the final base conversion logic does not need to handle div == 1 explicitly. It could add incorrect ""1"" at the end of the converted string."
/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversion.py,31:8-31:17,,"Instead of returning just an empty string when an unsupported format is provided to decimal_to_any_format, it might be better to return an explicit error message or raise a ValueError."
/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversion.py,11:0-11:64,,Using a global variable like ALPHABET_VALUES is not necessary. You could use the built-in chr function with ord('A') to calculate the letter corresponding to a value dynamically.
/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversion.py,54:4-54:23,,"decimal_to_any_base could utilize recursion or a stack to build the result string, which may simplify the code and avoid manual string reversal at the end."
/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversion.py,34:56-34:57,,"Enums or constant values can be used for bases (2, 8, 16) instead of magic numbers. This makes code more readable and flexible in case of changes."

/home/cr-study-2024/dev8/cr-study-2024/python/number-conversion/number_conversionpy,4:0-4:13,Why isn't this an enum?,documentation on `main.py` says `Format` is an enum
