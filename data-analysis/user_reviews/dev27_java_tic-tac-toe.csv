/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,107:4-107:23,,"The start() method is very long and does a lot of things.It would be better to extract some of the functionality into separate methods, such as readChoice(), updateWinStates(), and move(). This would make the code more readable and easier to maintain.\n\nConsider breaking down the input reading and validation into its own method for clarity and reuse."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,109:8-116:9,,"Think about isolating this feature into its own method, perhaps named readChoice(). Doing so could enhance the code's clarity, simplify maintenance, and prevent repeating the same code."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,124:0-128:94,,"Think about isolating this feature into its own method, perhaps named init(). Doing so could enhance the code's clarity and simplify maintenance."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,130:12-169:13,,"Think about isolating this feature into its own method, perhaps named startGame(). Doing so could enhance the code's clarity and simplify maintenance."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,140:24-149:25,,"You might want to consider refactoring this part of the code into independent methods, possibly called move() and updateWinState(). It would serve to increase the readability of the code, streamline its upkeep, and reduce redundancy, especially since this code is replicated in the compMove() method as well."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,117:8-117:34,,"The initial input validation could be improved: at the moment every value that is different than 'n' is considered as a ""yes"". Values that are different from 'y' or the empty value should be considered invalid and ignored. Optionally, a loop that ask the question until one of the two values is given may be considered."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,133:16-133:26,,"for loops that creates infinite loops with double semi columns are uncommon and may be surprising for the reader. Additionally, the design of infinite loops with exit conditions hidden in the code is generally not very readable and error prone.\nFinally, the two loops are redundant and can be avoided with a better structure."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,60:3-63:18,,Add a description of the fields improve code redability.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,262:8-269:10,,"The purpose of this block of code requires some comments in order to be understood quickly.\nThe use of ""magic"" values need to be commented and explained in order to be readable. Even if it possible to understand that it is the sequence of moves of the player, the representation is not very clear."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,61:4-61:17,,"This array is never recomputed or modified, and logically it should never differ from the default wins. For this reason, it can be a compile constant value and not recreated everytime. Adding the fact that it is final would improve the readability."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,293:12-293:69,,"wins is always the same, therefore recreating all those lists everytime is a waste of resources. Clearly, for those small data structures the problem is negligible."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,17:0-17:24,,"The code lacks useful comments in many places, it has methods that are too long and that do too many things, has a slightly confusing design, some weird statements and it mixes functional and imperative programming styles."
