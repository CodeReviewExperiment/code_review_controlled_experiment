/todo_list.py,6:0-6:18,,"The use of classes (TodoListApp and nested Task) and enums (Option and Sort) is appropriate for encapsulating functionality and maintaining application state.\n\nThe code is well documented, with each method having a clear docstring that describes its behavior, parameters, and return types. The class also provides module-level documentation for understanding the application's purpose and usage.\n\nMethod names like add_task, reverse_task_status, delete_task, list_tasks, etc., are descriptive and follow Python's naming conventions.\n\nThe usage of static methods (process_input_int and print_menu) where instance state isn't modified is a good practice.\n\nMore nuanced exceptions or custom exception classes can be used for specific error scenarios instead of printing error messages directly."
/todo_list.py,179:4-179:23,,"Enumerations are used effectively to represent the menu options and sorting methods, providing cleaner switch-case logic and better readability."
/todo_list.py,195:4-195:21,,"The Sort enum's members are created using functools.partial, which is a bit unconventional for readability. Enum values can be lambda functions directly or even better, method references."
/todo_list.py,79:8-82:72,,The list_tasks method can have the sorting logic refactored to a separate method for clarity.
/todo_list.py,135:4-135:21,,"The print_menu could dynamically generate the options based on the Option enum, eliminating the need to manually update the menu if new options are added."
/todo_list.py,130:16-130:22,,The exit() call in the interact_with_app method will globally exit Python and may not be desirable if the TodoListApp is to be used as part of a larger program. Consider raising an exception or setting a flag to break from the loop.
/todo_list.py,168:12-168:47,,Formatted string is not really needed here as the __str__ methof for the class is properly defined. However creation_date should probably be a @property to make it read-only and also make sure it always has the right format\n\nOld Review:\nRepresentation of the task's creation date might benefit from a formatted string for better readability.
/todo_list.py,193:16-193:68,,"The exit case in the Option enum's __str__ method raises a NotImplementedError as a default case. A default case in an Enum's __str__ method may not be necessary, and this behavior could be confusing."
/todo_list.py,89:4-89:43,,"Although process_input_int is robust in handling non-integer inputs, you could further improve user input validation for tasks (e.g., negative priority, string stripping)."
/todo_list.py,41:8-41:41,,There's no error handling for user inputs for positions that are already taken when marking tasks as done/undone or for incorrect input formats outside of integer validation.
/todo_list.py,167:12-167:36,,"Should probably be a property with setter and getter methods to guarantee its format. Also, would be nice to have the ability to define symbolic properties (Urgent, not important, etc)"
/todo_list.py,85:23-85:39,Wrong enumeration,"If done this way tasks are enumerated from 0 instead of 1. That makes the user pick the wrong task. You probably want:\nenumerate(tasks, start=1)"
