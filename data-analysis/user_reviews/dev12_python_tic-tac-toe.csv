/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,105:12-106:62,Bug: lack of validation,"The user input is not validated. If a user inputs a character that is not a number or an occupied position, the program will crash with a ValueError. Implementing input validation would improve the robustness."
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,44:4-44:18,,my_better_turn tries to block the opponent but does not aim to win if it has the opportunity. This function could be enhanced to check if the AI itself has a winning move available.
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,19:0-19:13,Wrong import,"Importing with from random import shuffle, randrange can make it difficult to identify where these functions come from later in the code. It is often clearer in Python to import the module and use random.shuffle and random.randrange."
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,91:0-95:21,Consider rewriting and extracting winning check,The checking for a win is done with list comprehension inside a loop which could be better organized. There is duplicated logic for checking if someone has won which could be refactored into its own function.
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,21:0-21:25,,"The game board is treated as a global variable causing its state to persist across successive calls to play. In a more extensive program with multiple modules, global variables can lead to bugs that are hard to track down."
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,44:4-44:18,,"The my_better_turn function immediately prints the AI's choice, which should ideally be handled in the game loop for separation of concerns and better control over the program's output.\n\nThere's no handling for incorrect AI behavior or unexpected conditions (like the board being full but still prompting for input). These situations should be accounted for to ensure the program does not enter an invalid state."
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,57:4-57:34,Consider better variable names,"The use of xo for the player's symbol is intuitive to someone familiar with Tic-Tac-Toe. However, variables like ox or single-letter variables such as b or s may not be self-explanatory."
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,87:8-87:76,Refactor and extract in function,The printing of the board is repeated several times throughout the play function. It could be refactored into its own function to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
/cr-study-2024/python/tic-tac-toe/tic_tac_toe.py,22:7-24:29,Consider programmatically generating this,"If the board size would be arbitrary, this list might be constructed programmatically."
