/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,55:5-56:7,,"The function throws exceptions, it whould state that in the documentation too"
/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,86:12-86:66,,Here we should also check for upper != str.length when appending the `appendToEnd` string
/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,26:5-41:38,,"It would be nice to specify in the documentation that lower and upper are the character's indexes for the given string.\nIt's specified that is just limits, but not of which granularity."
/cr-study-2024/java/word-utils/src/main/java/org/crprojects/WordUtils.java,21:0-21:24,,"The whole class is well documented, and all the functions seem not to have serious mistakes. The functions are well reused, even if some code patterns appear to be repeated in the functions with an inverse function, but it seems it's done on purpose for the sake of code clarity. This appears to be a good way to handle the functionality."
