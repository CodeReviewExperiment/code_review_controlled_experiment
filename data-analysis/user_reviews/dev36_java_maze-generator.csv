/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,140:8-143:20,MAYBE: Consider adding static const names for direction numbers,"Usage of magic numbers such as 1, 2, 4, 8 for directions could be replaced with named constants for clarity."
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,15:18-15:31,FIX: Add comment aoubt how grid works,The grid is represented as an int[][] array where the state of the walls is stored as a bit field. Some comments explaining how exactly this bit field works would help in understanding the logic.
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,111:8-111:55,FIX: Add extra validation for preventing unsolvable mazes,"The populate method uses Collections.shuffle which is good for randomizing arrays. However, since randomness is involved, there may not be a guarantee that the generated maze is always solvable without extra validation."
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,85:4-87:87,FIX: Add upper bound to width/height support,"For the random() method, it throws IllegalArgumentException if the dimensions are not positive but does not handle cases where the dimensions are too large, which might result in memory issues."
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,10:0-10:17,MAYBE: Consider splitting the Maze class in 2,"The Maze class handles both the creation of the maze and the representation of it as a string. For a more scalable design, consider separating the maze generation logic and its textual representation into separate classes or methods."
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,130:4-130:34,MAYBE: Change function name,The between method is not descriptive of what it actually checks. A name like isInRange might be clearer.
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,57:19-57:27,FIX: Add comment with more descriptive explanation of what is going on.,The toString method uses inline numerical and bitwise operations that assume a reader's understanding of how the maze is encoded. It may not be immediately evident what is happening without context or comments.
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,10:19-10:19,FIX: Love the use of Javadoc comments but they aren't descriptive enough,"The use of Javadoc comments is excellent, providing clear explanations for the class, its methods, and the Direction enum. Describing the purpose and functionality of each component helps maintainability and readability.\n\nSome complex lines of code, mainly those involving bitwise operations, would benefit from inline comments explaining step by step what they do.\n\nIt assumes that a path can be created validly using randomness, but without seeing more of the logic behind grid, it's hard to determine if there are safeguards against generating isolated segments.\n\nIn summary, the code is well structured and documented but there are a number of small improvements that could be made to ensure clarity, maintainability, performance, and correctness."
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,43:18-43:26,MAYBE: Consider using StringBuilder instead,"Since this string is being built in a loop and the width/height can be large, it is advisable to use StringBuilder. StringBuilder has an append() method which make it easier to concatenate to an existing string."
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,109:28-109:28,FIX: Add more descriptive comment,It is obvious what this recursive function is doing. Add better comments to explain it and how the code is guaranteed to be solveable every time.
