/StopWatch.py,14:4-24:19,,"Move the `State` and `SplitState` calsses outside of `StopWatch` class, consider to create different files.\nUse the built-in `enum` functionality instead of defining a `class`.\nAlso, consider to merge the two classes in a single `State` enum."
/StopWatch.py,26:4-39:33,,Move the `__init__` method at the start of the class. This will be automatically done when the two `State` and `SpitState` classes are moved outside the `StopWatch` class.

/StopWatch.py,34:8-35:50|185:8-186:50,,"Consider adding a default starting state to be reused in the `__init__` and `reset` methods.\nAlternatively, it is possible to create a new private method to initialize the states."
/StopWatch.py,230:8-236:59,,The stop function is not allowed only if the state is `UNSTARTED`. 
/StopWatch.py,239:4-239:22|224:4-224:19|199:4-199:20,,"Raise error if `split`, `stop` or `suspend` method are called twice."
