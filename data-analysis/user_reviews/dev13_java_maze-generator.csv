/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,43:18-43:26,,"In the toString() method, using StringBuilder is a more efficient way of creating a string than using String concatenation in loops, which is good. However, result += ... is still used for concatenating rows; it would be more efficient to use the StringBuilder here as well."

/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,140:0-141:19,,Shouldn't the dy of north and south be the other way around? North with dy = 1 and south with dy = -1
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,140:0-143:20,,"I would personally write the enum options in full (NORTH instead of N, SOUTH instead of S, etc.). Just for sake of clarity and readability"
