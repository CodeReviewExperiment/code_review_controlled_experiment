/number_conversion.py,4:6-4:12,,Enum?
/number_conversion.py,1:0-1:1,,module docstring missing (what are we doing here?)
/number_conversion.py,11:19-11:35,,explain
/number_conversion.py,30:7-30:89,,"use `if format_type not in Format` (once that's an enum), or refactor the whole thing into a switch statement with a corresponding default case."
/number_conversion.py,31:15-31:17,,"Exception instead of """"?"
/number_conversion.py,43:66-43:79,,why not exception/error?
/number_conversion.py,59:15-59:27,,"again, consider exception/error for all error messages"
/number_conversion.py,54:4-54:23,,"add unit tests (for all methods, not just this one)"
/number_conversion.py,72:8-72:33,,"consider collection of `actual_values` in list[str] and joining this at the end, for perfomance"
/number_conversion.py,67:8-79:39,,I am not certain if this is correct. Add unit tests before the next review round!
