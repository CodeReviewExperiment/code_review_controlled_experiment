/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,67:12-67:23,,The Player enum and Outcome record types are clean and idiomatic in Java.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,84:12-84:37,,"The use of sealed classes for defining Outcome restricts subclassing, which suits the limited outcomes in tic-tac-toe."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,24:12-24:18,,"`Static final` fields for default configurations (grids, wins) are a good design choice as these don't change."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,115:22-115:46,,The use of a runtime exception wrapper (UncheckedIOException) is an interesting choice. It simplifies the code but may not be best for handling user input errors. Consider user-friendly error messages instead.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,157:26-157:57,,Catching InterruptedException and re-interrupting the thread is a correct practice.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,137:64-137:81,,Integer.MIN_VALUE is used to denote cell weights that should no longer be considered. This is not intuitive. A named constant or another approach to marking unusable cells might be more readable.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,258:49-258:58,,The use of streams for sorting move sequences is clear but may not be necessary given the small fixed number of possible elements. This level of optimization is likely not needed and could be a simple loop.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,156:28-156:46,,"This is used to delay computer moves, potentially to mimic thinking. Use with caution, as this can make unit testing harder and could affect the user interface responsiveness."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,163:22-163:54,,You're catching RuntimeException around the game loop. This is too broad and could potentially catch unexpected exceptions that would be better handled explicitly or allowed to propagate up.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,107:4-107:25,,User input is read and immediately processed. Consider validating and sanitizing input better to handle unexpected inputs without crashing.\n\nConsider breaking down the input reading and validation into its own method for clarity and reuse.\n\nDefining values such as Integer.MIN_VALUE and hardcoded switches for special move sequences at the start can make the code easier to understand and modify.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,37:33-37:45,,You're using integer arrays to represent win states. A class or a more straightforward data structure to represent the state could improve code clarity and maintainability.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,17:0-17:22,,"Your code is organized and significant effort is apparent in architecting the game. You've used enums to represent players and records for outcomes, which is a good use of Java's type system.\n\nThe methods are well-structured with clear responsibilities.\nNaming is mostly clear and consistent, adhering to Java's naming standards.\n\nThe program is not designed for scalability beyond a 3x3 grid, but that is consistent with the standard tic-tac-toe game. If you plan on extending the game, you might need to refactor for flexibility.\nYour program is well put together, embodying many Java best practices. Careful attention is needed for error handling and input processing to ensure robustness. Keep potential scalability in the back of your mind, even if the current scope is limited. But, for a console-based tic-tac-toe game, it's quite thorough and shows a sound understanding of Java.\n\nYou have a good start with comments, but consider adding more on complex logic, especially around weight fixing and move decisions for the computer player."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,65:4-65:44,,The moves Map with Sets for tracking moves is an appropriate choice for quick look-ups and maintaining unique moves.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,49:31-49:46,,What does this mean? weight of what?
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,60:20-60:29,,Needs doc
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,99:12-99:46,,Why don't we do something similar to `Win` class here?
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,111:27-111:38,,Nit: maybe `.trim` to remove trailing/leading white spaces?
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,113:12-113:26,,"What do we expect here? to start the game, right? Because we exit only in case of `choice == 'n'`."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,119:8-119:66,,"Nit: Use of `Map` for two entries is a bit overkill, but it's fine."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,124:12-128:94,,Clearly documentation is here for this logic.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,131:12-133:26,,The use of two infinite nested loops makes the code unnecessarily complex.
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,139:24-139:72,,"If the player move is wrong, we should just ask again, but throwing an exception."
/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java,209:4-209:31,,This method is not acceptable without documentation. There are too many magic numbers everywhere.
