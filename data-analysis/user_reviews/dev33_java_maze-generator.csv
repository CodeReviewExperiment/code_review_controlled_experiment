/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,138:17-138:17,,"When working with grids and directions, clearly state what is the center of reference of your system and how each axys work. I had to retrieve from the code that going up means -1 in the grid. \nOne way coul be to add a small visual representation as a JavaDoc that immediately makes it clear.\n     N\n     |\n     |\nW ---+---> E\n     |\n     |\n     v\n     S"

Provide a clear and concise explanation comment.\n\nAfter looking through the entire file twice I think it stores the bit of the direction of the path through the maze? But if that is the case, couldn't this be a matrix of Direction instead of int?"
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,130:28-130:28,,"Consider changing the name of this function. A function called `between` makes me think of something (a receiver) that is in the range provided by the two parameters (value, upper): x.between(0, 10)"
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,57:20-57:20,,The implementation of this method is unclear and very hard to debug (and possibly modify in the future). Consider breaking it up in sections (for example one for each `for` statement and add comments before each section.
/cr-study-2024/java/maze-generator/src/main/java/org/crprojects/Maze.java,68:54-68:54,,If you are referencing `Direction.bit` consider replacing `8` with `Direction.W.bit` so that it is immediately clear what you mean without having to scroll through the file
