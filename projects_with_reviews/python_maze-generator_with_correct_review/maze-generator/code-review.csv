"","/maze_generator.py","","8:4-9:64","","The function does not validate the provided w and h arguments beyond the recommendation in the docstring that at least one dimension should be greater than 2. Adding explicit checks and raising a ValueError for invalid dimensions would make the program more robust.","0","","","16f7c6ff-3b33-40d1-adb2-e1c1d7648c93","0"
"","/maze_generator.py","","43:8-43:54","","It looks like there might be a small mistake in the documentation for the parameters. The description for param y is currently a duplicate of the param x description. To avoid any confusion:\n\nThe :param y: should describe the y-coordinate, not the x-coordinate.\nThe description should read something like :param y: The current y-coordinate in the maze.\nCould you please update the documentation to reflect the correct information for param y? Thank you!","0","","","7d196d8c-0d95-4276-beca-8a08783ee1eb","0"
