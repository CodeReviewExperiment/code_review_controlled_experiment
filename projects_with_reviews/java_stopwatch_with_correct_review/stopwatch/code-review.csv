"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/StopWatch.java","","42:0-42:24","","Error handling is consistent. The class throws exceptions if the methods are called out of order; e.g., stop before start.\nThough the RuntimeException is used, for a more granular control, creating a custom unchecked exception (such as IllegalStopWatchStateException) could be beneficial for clients of the StopWatch class.","0","","","777759b0-94ea-4822-8f44-551d955b6bbf","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/StopWatch.java","","401:23-401:36","","I noticed a discrepancy in the constant naming. The constant 'MILLIS_2_NANO' does not align with the method name nanoToMillis() and its description. To maintain consistency, the constant should be renamed to 'NANO_2_MILLIS'.","0","","","337448c2-ddfa-47f5-84b4-1f8a7c647898","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/StopWatch.java","","254:8-259:9","","The getNanoTime method seems to contain unnecessary code duplication. The first two if statements both return the same value, which could be simplified to reduce redundancy. Consider consolidating the conditions to avoid repetitive code and enhance maintainability.","0","","","f803cacf-0516-4804-83d7-9827a4cfb113","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/StopWatch.java","","482:8-486:9","","The stop method contains an unnecessary nested if statement. The condition inside the first if block can be simplified by combining it with the second if statement to achieve a clearer and more concise logic flow. Reducing the complexity of these conditional checks will lead to improved readability and maintainability of the code.","0","","","68c5a7a6-7491-4bdb-83d1-bc0f3b72a00f","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/StopWatch.java","","377:15-377:51","","The documentation for the isStopped() method is inaccurate. It currently states that the method is checking whether the stopwatch is started, whereas it should reflect the correct behavior, which is determining whether the stopwatch is actually stopped. This discrepancy should be addressed to ensure clarity and correctness for users of this method.","0","","","ec8b8dea-a1c6-4d16-89c0-079a7e15dae3","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/StopWatch.java","","385:5-387:51","","The documentation for the isSuspended() method contains inaccuracies. The main description should reflect that the method is testing whether the stopwatch is suspended, not just started. Additionally, the @return description is incorrect, as it should specify that the method returns a boolean indicating whether the stopwatch is suspended. These issues need to be corrected for better clarity and understanding.","0","","","417ae48d-9520-4a0b-b4bf-12c27cf52567","0"
