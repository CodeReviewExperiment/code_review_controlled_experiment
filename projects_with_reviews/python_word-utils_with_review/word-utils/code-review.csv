"","/WordUtils.py","","63:8-64:65","","The method logic is sound for abbreviating strings based on lower and upper limits. However, the initial check for upper < 0 might be unnecessary since the method raises an error if upper is less than lower, and there's a later condition that sets upper to the string length if it's greater.\n\nHowever, this is misleading because the method documentation says to specify -1 to disable the upper limit, but this condition will prevent using -1 as intended. This seems to be a discrepancy between the documentation and implementation.","0","","","c2eba74e-bc1c-422d-8e93-1f49c81fa6e7","0"
"","/WordUtils.py","","91:4-91:70","","Both methods capitalize and capitalize_fully handle capitalization using a set of delimiters. The implementation with a callback and flag is correct but might be more complex than necessary. Python's string methods, such as split and join, along with list comprehensions, could potentially simplify the implementation.","0","","","25702bab-17dd-4cbf-9e67-7d60d4139ff5","0"
"","/WordUtils.py","","163:4-163:76","","This method effectively calls capitalize on a lowercased version of the input string. This is a clean way to ensure full capitalization but may introduce extra processing for large strings. Consider if direct manipulation without lowering and then capitalizing might be more efficient in some cases.","0","","","b668b0dc-6cc9-45cf-a9a5-774badec1bf0","0"
"","/WordUtils.py","","244:12-244:70","","The method compiles a new regex for each word checked. Compiling regexes can be expensive, especially in a loop for many words. Consider if there's a way to check word presence without compiling a regex for each word, possibly using set operations or other string methods.","0","","","ecd193f1-08e0-4428-98a2-9f769c54ae6b","0"
"","/WordUtils.py","","251:4-251:68","","The method has a unique approach to handling delimiters, including treating whitespace as a default delimiter. This works well, but the method could potentially be simplified by using regular expressions or built-in string functions.","0","","","c864f778-9677-4305-8c57-eef1059d4092","0"
"","/WordUtils.py","","312:4-312:41","","The custom logic for swapping case based on character position and whitespace detection is correct. However, this method's logic might be more complex than necessary for achieving the desired result, especially considering Python's built-in swapcase method, which swaps the case of all letters in a string. The additional logic for handling title case and conversion after whitespace or at the start adds value beyond swapcase, but it's worth noting the complexity added.","0","","","513979fb-563e-4f6e-a4da-d959d3050295","0"
"","/WordUtils.py","","362:4-362:72","","Similar to capitalize: This method shares logic with capitalize, but inversely applies case changes. The same suggestions about simplification apply here.","0","","","436417b9-b3aa-4250-90a0-24348e1fa26c","0"
