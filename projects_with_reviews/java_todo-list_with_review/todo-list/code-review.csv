"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TodoListApp.java","","161:16-161:31","","Using System.exit(0) to terminate the program is generally not preferred in Java applications outside of CLI tools as it prevents cleanup and shutdown hooks from running. Consider alternatives for exiting the loop.","0","","","959f59f0-dc0b-4a9f-bcfb-0bd91961e250","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TodoListApp.java","","127:4-127:34","","There are several hardcoded strings that are used directly in your methods. For better manageability and localization support, consider using constants or a resource file for storing such strings.\n\nThe application runs in an infinite loop. You might want to consider having a condition that allows for a graceful shutdown.\n\nThereâ€™s repetitive code (e.g., in gathering user input) that may be refactored into methods to reduce code duplication.\n\nYou've avoided 'magic numbers' in the menu interaction, which is good.\n\nThe program handles integer parsing from user input gracefully by continuously prompting the user until a valid number is received.","0","","","8f20e721-bb8f-42ec-87c0-0ec3079ec2c2","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TodoListApp.java","","52:31-52:52","","Instead of just printing ""Invalid task index,"" it may be helpful to the user to know what valid range is or what caused the input to be invalid.","0","","","67783817-6a2f-4eda-b255-b497bcb44962","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TodoListApp.java","","145:39-145:52","","The application requires the user to enter an index base-1, which is correct from a user perspective, but can be confusing. Consider adjusting the prompts or handling the index translation inside the app methods.","0","","","003d5abe-3ac1-4f79-a4c1-ffe7c100a20c","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TodoListApp.java","","15:4-15:59","","Scanner objects should generally be closed when no longer needed, but here you have to be careful because closing the scanner would also close System.in, which you cannot open again. Ordinarily, resources should be managed with try-with-resources or manually closed when done.","0","","","e800f76f-39c4-4830-ac9b-0568745ad61c","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TodoListApp.java","","193:4-193:29","","The Task inner class appropriately encapsulates task-related data. You use a simple ArrayList to manage tasks, which works okay for a basic application like this.","0","","","3a2f8be0-efae-49d9-a8dd-19376c2bd92c","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TodoListApp.java","","11:0-12:0","","The methods are well-organized with clear names indicating their functionality.\n\nFields and constructors are used appropriately. tasks is final, indicating it should not be reassigned after initialization.\n\nAll TodoListApp methods are package-private, which suggests that you intend for this class to be used only within its package. Be explicit about method visibility for clarity.\n\nThe app's main logic is intermingled with input/output. For future enhancements and better maintainability, consider separating business logic from user interaction and I/O operations.","0","","","1d52b06e-42ef-4918-95be-86e54b2b590b","0"
