"","/StopWatch.py","","12:4-12:27","","It seems that there is an inconsistency between the constant name MILLIS_2_NANO and its intended usage as documented. The given description mentions it as a constant to convert nanoseconds to milliseconds, but the name suggests the opposite. This inconsistency should be resolved to ensure clarity and accuracy in the codebase.","0","","","adff0be7-7155-4a20-ac15-1e02b0913642","0"
"","/StopWatch.py","","105:8-105:19","","It appears that there is a documentation discrepancy in the get_split_time method. The :rtype: is documented as a string, whereas the function actually returns the split time in milliseconds, which should be indicated as an integer. It's important to update the documentation to accurately reflect the data type being returned.","0","","","02c64095-787c-47c7-95a6-c2492295e88f","0"
"","/StopWatch.py","","216:8-219:79","","The start method in its current form contains unnecessary code duplication. The first two if statements both raise the same ValueError and serve an identical purpose, which could be streamlined by consolidating the conditions into a single if statement. This will help simplify the code and reduce redundancy. Consider revising the method to remove this unnecessary duplication and improve the code's maintainability.","0","","","f1767fc6-6a1c-4c3f-8fa2-984ebb31b513","0"
