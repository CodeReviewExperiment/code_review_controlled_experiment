"","/tic_tac_toe.py","","76:4-76:17","","The current return statement of return choice should actually be modified to return choice + 1. While the game's internal logic appears to be accurate, the output communicated to the player does not align with a typical user's expectation of a 1-based index for the move position. Adjusting the return value to reflect this will improve the player's experience by providing a more intuitive move announcement.","0","","","a2facd3c-8bfd-4036-b0ea-c0b6a56a1873","0"
