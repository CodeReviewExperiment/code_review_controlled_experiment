"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java","","107:4-107:23","","The start() method is very long and does a lot of things.It would be better to extract some of the functionality into separate methods, such as readChoice(), updateWinStates(), and move(). This would make the code more readable and easier to maintain.\n\nConsider breaking down the input reading and validation into its own method for clarity and reuse.","0","","","4cd0ca24-9552-4b85-b3f6-9b1d4ac9083f","0"

Doing so could enhance the code's clarity, simplify maintenance, and prevent repeating the same code.","0","","","ab542961-c6d7-4f68-9b21-6fa5277ba949","0"

"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java","","140:24-149:25","","You might want to consider refactoring this part of the code into independent methods, possibly called move() and updateWinState(). It would serve to increase the readability of the code, streamline its upkeep, and reduce redundancy, especially since this code is replicated in the compMove() method as well.","0","","","8beebff0-0502-44df-8be7-d33e48fc2aa6","0"
