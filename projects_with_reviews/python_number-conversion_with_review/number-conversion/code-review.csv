"","/number_conversion.py","","2:0-2:0","","Functions are well-organized and focused on singular tasks, with decimal_to_any_format as the top-level function that delegates to system-specific conversion functions based on the format passed.\n\nThe code adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines, with appropriate naming conventions and documentation through docstrings.\n\nType hints are provided for function parameters and return types, improving the code's readability and allowing for static type checking.\n\nProvided for each function, mentioning purpose, parameters, and return type; however, the decimal_to_roman docstring contains a mismatch regarding the range it allows.","0","","","e69ffaef-3f3d-4a56-bb13-3dc6a9568891","0"

The documentation states ""0 and 4000 (both included)"" but the code excludes both these values. It should be corrected to match.","0","","","a49afaa5-b034-42c2-b51a-08c32e033717","0"
