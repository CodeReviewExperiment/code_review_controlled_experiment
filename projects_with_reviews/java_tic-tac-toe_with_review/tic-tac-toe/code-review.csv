"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java","","115:22-115:46","","The use of a runtime exception wrapper (UncheckedIOException) is an interesting choice. It simplifies the code but may not be best for handling user input errors. Consider user-friendly error messages instead.","0","","","f673e0f2-18ff-47c1-bf5b-4c263f276b2f","0"

"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java","","137:64-137:81","","Integer.MIN_VALUE is used to denote cell weights that should no longer be considered. This is not intuitive.

"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java","","156:28-156:46","","This is used to delay computer moves, potentially to mimic thinking.

"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java","","163:22-163:54","","You're catching RuntimeException around the game loop.

"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java","","107:4-107:25","","User input is read and immediately processed. Consider validating and sanitizing input better to handle unexpected inputs without crashing.\n\nConsider breaking down the input reading and validation into its own method for clarity and reuse.\n\nDefining values such as Integer.MIN_VALUE and hardcoded switches for special move sequences at the start can make the code easier to understand and modify.","0","","","d2220c5b-97a3-4468-a12f-18510309ab85","0"

"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/TicTacToe.java","","17:0-17:22","","Your code is organized and significant effort is apparent in architecting the game. You've used enums to represent players and records for outcomes, which is a good use of Java's type system.\n\nThe methods are well-structured with clear responsibilities.\nNaming is mostly clear and consistent, adhering to Java's naming standards.\n\nThe program is not designed for scalability beyond a 3x3 grid, but that is consistent with the standard tic-tac-toe game. If you plan on extending the game, you might need to refactor for flexibility.\nYour program is well put together, embodying many Java best practices. Careful attention is needed for error handling and input processing to ensure robustness. Keep potential scalability in the back of your mind, even if the current scope is limited. But, for a console-based tic-tac-toe game, it's quite thorough and shows a sound understanding of Java.\n\nYou have a good start with comments, but consider adding more on complex logic, especially around weight fixing and move decisions for the computer player.","0","","","cf9d8273-dff9-445d-b2a0-282255c3db4e","0"
