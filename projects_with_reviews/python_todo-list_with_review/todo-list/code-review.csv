"","/todo_list.py","","6:0-6:18","","The use of classes (TodoListApp and nested Task) and enums (Option and Sort) is appropriate for encapsulating functionality and maintaining application state.\n\nThe code is well documented, with each method having a clear docstring that describes its behavior, parameters, and return types. The class also provides module-level documentation for understanding the application's purpose and usage.\n\nMethod names like add_task, reverse_task_status, delete_task, list_tasks, etc., are descriptive and follow Python's naming conventions.\n\nThe usage of static methods (process_input_int and print_menu) where instance state isn't modified is a good practice.\n\nMore nuanced exceptions or custom exception classes can be used for specific error scenarios instead of printing error messages directly.","0","","","7a28e4ef-7150-49b2-bcb9-a147af939d9d","0"
