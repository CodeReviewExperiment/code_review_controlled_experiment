"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/NumberConversion.java","","57:12-57:57","","There is a critical bug. For HEXADECIMAL, it erroneously uses base 8 instead of 16. It should be decimalToAnyBase(num, 16).","0","","","4e7917e0-ef14-4b02-80da-f5b6220ac875","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/NumberConversion.java","","71:8-71:40","","Bounds checking in decimalToRoman prevents negative numbers and those greater than 4000, which is excellent. However, the condition should reject the number 4000 as well since it's not representable in the standard Roman numeral system (I to MMMCMXCIX).","0","","","f6b55fb6-b9bb-4838-94e6-5feac393e0d7","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/NumberConversion.java","","3:0-3:31","","The class NumberConversion is aptly named for its purpose, as are the variable arrays for ARABIAN_NUMBERS and ROMAN_NUMBERS.\nEnums are used well to define constants for Format, improving readability and safety in switch statements.\n\nThe program uses string messages for error reporting that are returned to the caller. Consider throwing an exception for invalid inputs, which is more in line with Java's error-handling philosophy.\n\nThe code seems maintainable with clear separation of logic into different methods based on functionality.\nThe hard-coded values in the arrays make it easy to see and update the Roman numeral mappings.\n\nCode comments are generally useful, although the comment for decimalToAnyFormat is somewhat redundant. Method names are clear on what the methods do, so comments might instead explain non-obvious parts of the implementation.\n\nThere's no handling for Integer overflow or underflow. If truly large numbers were input, the behavior is undefined. While the current limits should prevent this, future changes to the code could introduce risks.\n\nDocumentation can be improved by adding @param and @return tags for methods.","0","","","2e85b565-bc18-45d0-91d5-856a7490f2d9","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/NumberConversion.java","","5:31-5:46","","The array names ARABIAN_NUMBERS and ROMAN_NUMBERS may be misleading. It would be clearer to name them ROMAN_VALUES and ROMAN_SYMBOLS, respectively.","0","","","7eb76880-f257-4695-88f7-9428bc1509e2","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/NumberConversion.java","","88:7-89:14","","The comment on the decimalToAnyBase method incorrectly states ""converts decimal to Roman format"". This seems to be a copy-paste error from the other method, and should describe conversion to a generic base instead.","0","","","339de73a-0b20-4c31-b98a-5c9f647366df","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/NumberConversion.java","","75:8-75:52","","Use of a StringBuilder in both decimalToRoman and decimalToAnyBase is good for efficiency.","0","","","8dd10732-1f45-4d7e-b99c-43a1a0652a6d","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/NumberConversion.java","","70:4-70:53","","In the decimalToRoman and decimalToAnyBase methods, the if statements to check for invalid inputs are placed before creating a StringBuilder, which is good because it avoids unnecessary object creation.","0","","","4cd34edd-95f1-4f1b-a4e6-9f0ae872f405","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/NumberConversion.java","","70:4-70:11","","The method decimalToRoman could be public to get accessed directly by the users, considering it's a common conversion.","0","","","58059021-5c76-4374-a74c-bd08d641b830","0"
"","/src/main/java/org/crprojects/NumberConversion.java","","95:26-95:42","","Consider renaming the method decimalToAnyBase to something more specific like decimalToBaseN to immediately convey that it allows for different bases, not just Roman.","0","","","e0893aca-7276-48f3-ae5b-59b67b195bfd","0"
