This file should NOT be reviewed. Its only purpose is to showcase the
functionality of the tic-tac-toe program. In what follows, a brief
specification of the program is provided:

This is a tic-tac-toe game played via CLI against an agent that is
programmed to not lose. The agent plays first. In each turn, the board
is printed to the console and the player is asked to enter the coordinates
of the square to mark. The game ends when one of the players wins or when
the board is full.
