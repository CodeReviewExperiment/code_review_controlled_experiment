Dear [*NAME*],

Thank you for accepting to participate in our code review study. Your work is very much appreciated and it will be very valuable for our research.

In this email, you find instructions to access the server and complete the code reviews assigned to you.

Accessing the server

To perform the code reviews, you need to use Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code offers a plugin for remote development called Remote - SSH. You need this plugin to access the server where you will complete your code reviews.

To access the server, you need to connect via SSH through Visual Studio Code. Simply open the Remote plugin tab on Visual Studio Code, add a new connection and type the following command:

ssh devXX@[*SERVER_NAME*]

As you can see, you have been assigned the user devXX. When prompted for the password, type the following:

[*PASSWORD*]

Instructions for the code review
1. Once logged in, you can start your code review assignments, in one or multiple sessions.
2. The projects to review are located under ~/cr-study-2024/<language>/<project>/. You should see three different projects.
3. For each project, you should see a README.md file. Make sure to read it at least for one project, since it contains information about where to find a description of the project to review, and how to use the code review plugin in Visual Studio Code.
4. IMPORTANT: For the code review plugin to work properly, you need to perform the code reviews by opening either the home folder (~/) or the project folder (~/cr-study-2024/<language>/<project>/). The code review plugin will NOT work if you open a different folder (e.g., ~/cr-study-2024/ or ~/cr-study-2024/<language>/).

Rating the confidence of your review

When you finish reviewing a project, please make sure to rate how confident you are about your review. Simply write the confidence (from 1 to 5) in the README.md file under the root project folder.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Thank you again for your contribution.

Happy reviewing!
